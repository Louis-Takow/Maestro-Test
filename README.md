# Mobile-Automation--MAESTRO: Swag Labs

## Overview
This project provides a mobile automation testing framework for the **Swag Labs** Android application using **Maestro**. The script is designed to validate core functionalities (smoke testing) such as logging in, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.

The framework leverages **Maestro Studio** for visual debugging and simplifies mobile app testing, ensuring that critical workflows are tested with minimal setup. This smoke testing ensures that the main functionality of the Swag Labs app works as expected.

## Prerequisites

1. **Maestro**: Follow the [Maestro installation guide](https://docs.maestro.mobile) to set up Maestro on your system.
2. **Android Emulator or Device**: Ensure you have an Android emulator set up via **Android Studio** or a physical Android device connected.
3. **Swag Labs Mobile App**: Install the open-source **Swag Labs** mobile app on your emulator or physical device.
4. **Appium Desktop GUI (optional)**: If you plan to use Appium inspector for additional interaction or UI element inspection, ensure it’s set up.

## Steps to Set Up and Run Tests

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Mobile-Automation--MAESTRO.git
cd Mobile-Automation--MAESTRO
```

### 2. Configure the App ID

Update the `appId` field in the script with the correct package name for the Swag Labs app:
```yaml
appId: com.swaglabsmobileapp # Replace with the app's package name
```

### 3. Run the Smoke Test
Navigate to test file directory e.g 
```bash
cd C:\Users\{username}\Desktop\Maestro Test\test-flows
```
To run the smoke test, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
maestro test smoke_test.yaml
```

### 4. Use Maestro Studio for Visual Debugging

**Maestro Studio** provides a user-friendly interface to help you:

- **Inspect Elements**: Identify and interact with UI elements visually.
- **Debug Locators**: Test your element locators directly in the visual interface.
- **Modify Tests**: Easily modify test flows and commands using a GUI without writing code.

Follow these steps to use **Maestro Studio** effectively:

1. Launch **Maestro Studio**.
2. Connect your device or emulator to **Maestro Studio**.
3. Start a new session, select the Swag Labs app, and use the **UI Inspector** to explore elements.
4. Use the **Visual Flow Builder** to create and edit test cases with drag-and-drop actions.

### 5. View the Results

Maestro will automatically display the results of the test execution in the terminal. In **Maestro Studio**, you can also monitor test execution in real-time and inspect any failures visually.

## Test Scenarios (Smoke Testing)

The smoke testing script validates the following core functionalities of the Swag Labs mobile app:

1. **Login Test**: 
   - Verify that the app allows users to log in using valid credentials (`standard_user` and `secret_sauce`).
   - Ensure that invalid credentials show the appropriate error message.

2. **Add to Cart**:
   - Ensure that users can add products to the cart successfully.
   - Verify that the cart can be viewed after items are added.

3. **Checkout Process**:
   - Verify that users can proceed through the checkout process after adding products to the cart.
   - Ensure that the checkout form (e.g., name, postal code) can be filled out and submitted.

4. **Logout Test**:
   - Verify that users can log out of the app after completing the checkout process.

## Best Practices

To ensure reliable and maintainable tests, the following best practices are implemented:

### 1. **Use Explicit Waits**

Instead of relying on fixed wait times, the script uses explicit waits and selectors like `extendedWaitUntil` to ensure elements are visible before interacting with them. This reduces flakiness and ensures the app is ready for the next action.

### 2. **Efficient Element Locators**

Implemented a combination of text selectors, regex selectors, and relative positioning to target UI elements accurately. This helps avoid brittle locators that break easily with minor changes in the UI.

### 3. **Modular Test Cases**

The test cases are modular, each focusing on a specific aspect of the app (e.g., login, checkout). This makes it easier to isolate issues and reuse test components for future testing scenarios.

### 4. **Randomized Inputs**

For more robust testing, some inputs (like the postal code) are randomized. This ensures that the test covers a wider variety of input cases and isn’t limited to hardcoded values.

### 5. **Environment Configurations**

The test setup is designed to be environment-agnostic, meaning that the configuration for different devices or platforms can be easily switched without modifying the test code.

### 6. **Test Assertions**

After key actions like logging in and completing checkout, assertions for the presence of specific elements have been implemented (e.g., product listings, confirmation messages) to verify the expected outcome.

### 7. **Comprehensive Error Handling**

The script includes error handling techniques like `assertVisible` and custom wait times to handle any issues related to loading elements or interactions with the app.

## Troubleshooting

- **App Installation**: Ensure the app is correctly installed on the emulator or device. You can verify this using `adb devices` or opening the app manually.
- **App ID**: Double-check the `appId` in the script to match the package name of the Swag Labs app.
- **Element Selectors**: If an element is not found, use Maestro Studio to inspect elements and debug locators.
- **Emulator Issues**: If the emulator is not detected, ensure it’s running properly and that the environment variables are set correctly.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet powerful framework to automate mobile app testing for the **Swag Labs** application using **Maestro**. By leveraging **Maestro Studio** for visual debugging and following best practices, you can efficiently test and troubleshoot critical workflows, ensuring that core functionalities like login, cart management, and checkout work as expected.
